Good luck with everything; I'll be back as soon as I can.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** Thanks, Jim and Mitzi. If you think of anything else, just let us know. Leroy, I'm so worried about telling Ava about Flopsy. She adores him.\\n\\n**Leroy:** Yeah, she's always had such a bond with Flopsy. The last thing we want is for her to think he's gone for good.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** Exactly. It would really crush her spirit. She’s seen him as more than just a pet, you know?\\n\\n**Leroy:** I know. Maybe we should focus on how Flopsy is just on another one of his adventures. It might make it easier for her to handle for now.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** That might work. But deep down, I hope we can bring him back safe soon. Otherwise, we’ll have to find the right words to comfort her.\\n\\n**Leroy:** Let’s keep our fingers crossed that it won’t come to that. We’ve got a lot of neighbors on the lookout, and I have a good feeling they’ll spot him soon.\",\n",

Do you think there’s still a chance we might find him?\\n\\n**Mitzi:** Honestly, we’ve tried a lot already. If we haven’t heard anything by now, he may have wandered too far. It’s tough, but Flopsy might not come back home.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** I know, but it’s hard to accept. Ava will be devastated; she’s always treated him like a little friend.\\n\\n**Mitzi:** I have to leave again, unfortunately. The dog is looking at me like I owe him dinner.

I double-checked before we went out for dinner. Maybe there's a hole in the fence we didn't see?\\n\\n**Jim:** I feel so bad, I should have made sure he was safe in his hutch before we left.You think he wandered off to the neighbor’s yard, Mom?\\n\\n**Mitzi:** That’s possible, Jim. Flopsy has always been a bit of an explorer, hasn’t he? I can help print some flyers. Maybe we should include a picture of him.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** Good idea, Mitzi. We'll need to spread the word as widely as possible. Maybe I should post something on our neighborhood's online group too.\\n\\n**Leroy:** We can also check nearby shelters and see if anyone’s turned him in. And maybe we can offer a small reward for his safe return—people might pay more attention that way.\\n\\n**Jim:** I hope he's safe. Do you think I could make some signs to put up at school? Then my friends could keep an eye out for him during recess.\\n\\n**Mitzi:** That’s a great plan, Jim! By getting your school friends involved, we can cover more ground. You never know who might spot him.\\n\\n**Kalyn:** While Jim is making those signs, I'll start calling around to local vets. Maybe someone’s seen a little bunny wandering nearby.\\n\\n**Leroy:** Sounds like we're all set then. Let's spread out and get started. We’ll find Flopsy; I just know it.\\n\\n**Jim:** Excuse me, but I really need to use the bathroom. I'll catch up with you all soon.\\n\\n**Mitzi:** I've just got an urgent call to take.
