There's something about the complexity and improvisation in jazz that keeps me hooked.\\n\\nCourtney: That's interesting, Gryphon. I actually lean more towards pop and indie music. I love discovering new artists with unique sounds.\\n\\nAngelik: We have quite the variety here! I personally can't get enough of electronic music. The beats just get me energized and ready for anything.\\n\\nBerthal: It's cool how music can be so different yet connect us in its own way. Courtney, have you found any new indie artists lately?\\n\\nCourtney: Oh, definitely! There's this new band called The Paper Kites I've been listening to. Their music is so soothing, and their lyrics are poetic.\\n\\nGryphon: I've heard of them! They have a track that blends beautifully with a jazz saxophone solo. It's a fascinating combination.\\n\\nAngelik: That sounds right up my alley. I love when genres blend. It makes the music feel so fresh and unexpected.\\n\\nBerthal: I guess we're lucky to have such diverse tastes in the office. Maybe we should collaborate on a team playlist one day and see what kind of mix we end up with. \\n\\nCourtney: That's a great idea, Berthal! It would be fun to see everyone's contributions and discover new favorites together.Berthal: Oh, speaking of which, I need to step away for a moment. Nature calls! \\n\\nCourtney: And I should head out too; I need to make a quick trip to the grocery store. Catch you all later!\\n\\nAngelik: Later, you two! Anyway, Gryphon, I've always thought that electronic music just has this unmatched energy. \\n\\nGryphon: I completely get why you’d feel that way. It’s great for getting you moving. Though I'm curious how you feel about Berthal’s classic rock?\\n\\nAngelik: To be honest, it's not really my thing. I respect it, but it doesn't quite resonate with me like electronic does. It's just a bit too... predictable, if you know what I mean.\\n\\nGryphon: That's fair. We all have our preferences. I suppose that’s what makes music so personal. Are there any new electronic artists you're excited about?\\n\\nAngelik: Absolutely! There's this new artist called ODESZA. Their tracks have such innovative soundscapes. It’s like a sonic adventure every time I listen.Courtney: I'm back just in time to catch that! ODESZA is amazing. Their music does take you on a journey, doesn't it?\\n\\nGryphon: Welcome back, Courtney! We were just talking about different music genres and how they vibe with us. What did you decide to pick up from the store?\\n\\nCourtney: It was a quick trip for some essentials. You know how it is — milk, bread, that kind of thing. So, what’s everyone planning for after work today?\\n\\nAngelik: I’m thinking of just heading straight home. It's been a long day, and I could use some downtime. How about you, Gryphon?\\n\\nGryphon: I’m planning to unwind with some jazz at that new café that opened up. They have live performances in the evening.\\n\\nCourtney: That sounds so relaxing! I think I’ll follow your lead and grab a drink somewhere local. I'll catch you later!Berthal: I'm back! Sorry about the sudden exit earlier. Anyway, guess what? There's a classic rock live show tonight, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in joining me, Angelik?\\n\\nAngelik: Hey, welcome back! That sounds like a fun night, but I actually already have some plans. Maybe next time?\\n\\nBerthal: No worries at all. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Hope your plans are just as thrilling!\\n\\nGryphon: A live show sounds like so much fun! Where's it happening, Berthal?\\n\\nBerthal: It's at that new venue downtown. They’ve got a great lineup — pure classic rock nostalgia. You're welcome to come along if you want.\\n\\nGryphon: Thanks for the invite! I'll think about it; I might still join you after my café stop.\\n\\nCourtney: Sounds exciting! If only I didn't already commit to something else. But have a great time and maybe share some highlights later!\",\n",

              " 'short_context': \"Berthal: Actually, speaking of the daily grind, I need to take a quick break. Nature calls! Catch you all later.\\n\\nCourtney: And I should head off too. Need to make a quick trip to the grocery store before it gets too late. See you soon, everyone!\\n\\nAngelik: Bye, Berthal! Take care, Courtney! So, Gryphon, would you say that electronic music really dominates your playlist?\\n\\nGryphon: It does, but I'm always exploring new genres. I love the diversity in music. However, you seem to have a special interest in classical, don't you?\\n\\nAngelik: I certainly do. I feel like classical has an unmatched depth and complexity. I wouldn’t trade it for anything, especially not overplayed rock bands. What about you? Why electronic?\\n\\nGryphon: For me, it’s the energy and rhythm of electronic music. It’s almost like it pushes me to do more. But I get your point about classical being rich. It's like diving into the layers of a well-crafted story.\\n\\nAngelik: Exactly! There’s so much to discover with each listen. I guess that’s why I find it so fascinating—every piece has its own narrative.\\n\\nCourtney: Hey, I'm back! Just in time to catch the end of this interesting music chat. \\n\\nGryphon: Welcome back, Courtney! We're just diving into how music influences our work routines. Got anything else on your mind?\\n\\nCourtney: Well, after work, I'm thinking about unwinding a bit. The day’s been hectic, and there's nothing like relaxing to some tunes.\\n\\nAngelik: That sounds great, Courtney! Have any specific plans in mind for after work, or just going with the flow?\\n\\nCourtney: Honestly, I haven’t decided what to do yet. Might just play it by ear and see where the evening takes me.\\n\\nGryphon: That can be refreshing. Sometimes the best moments are the unplanned ones.\\n\\nCourtney: True! Anyway, I need to leave again. I’m going to grab a drink. Catch you all later!\\n\\nBerthal: Hey, I'm back! Hope I didn't miss too much. You know, speaking of music, there's a classic rock live show tonight. Angelik, would you like to join me?\\n\\nAngelik: Thanks for the invite, Berthal, but I already have some plans for tonight.\\n\\nBerthal: No worries! Maybe some other time then. Hope you enjoy whatever you're up to.\\n\\nGryphon: A classic rock show sounds awesome, though. Who's playing?\\n\\nBerthal: It's a local band but they've got that authentic old-school vibe. I think they usually play covers of the big names like Deep Purple and Pink Floyd.\\n\\nGryphon: Sounds like a blast! I might check them out in the future. Enjoy the show, Berthal!\",\n",
