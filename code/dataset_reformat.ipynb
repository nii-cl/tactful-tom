       "**Cornell:** So, we're all here at lunch, and I have to ask—what's everyone's favorite cuisine? I've been trying to expand my palate a bit.    \n",
       "**Isobella:** That's a great question, Cornell! I think I'd have to go with Italian. There's just something so comforting about a bowl of pasta.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** Italian is solid, but for me, it's all about the spices with Indian cuisine. You just can't beat a good curry.    \n",
       "**Mckenize:** Oooh, those are both good choices. I'm a fan of Japanese food, especially sushi. It's like art you can eat!    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Those all sound amazing. I've been really into Mediterranean lately. There's so much variation with flavors and it's usually pretty healthy too.    \n",
       "**Isobella:** Mediterranean is a great choice, Cornell! It’s hard not to love dishes that come with a side of warm pita bread.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** Agreed! And speaking of bread, Israeli cuisine has some of the best I've tasted. Shakshuka and hummus are my go-tos.    \n",
       "**Mckenize:** Now I'm craving a little bit of everything! Maybe we should do a potluck lunch at some point and bring a dish from our favorite cuisine.    \n",
       "**Cornell:** That's a fantastic idea, Mckenize. It would be a fun way to explore different cuisines without having to buy a plane ticket.    \n",
       "**Isobella:** I'm on board! I'll whip up a pasta dish that'll knock your socks off. Let's plan it for next Friday!    \n",
       "**Isobella:** Oh, I just remembered I need to quickly check something. Can you all excuse me for a moment? I want to confirm the details for an appointment I have coming up.    \n",
       "**Mckenize:** And I need to step away to refill my water bottle. I'll be back soon.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** No problem! We’ll be right here when you return.     \n",
       "**Cornell:** Sure thing. In the meantime, Arvilla, have you been to any of the newer restaurants around town recently?    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** I have! There’s been a lot of buzz around a few of them, but some are a bit on the pricier side.    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Yeah, I've noticed that too. Honestly, I usually prefer places that offer good food without the hefty price tag.     \n",
       "**Arvilla:** I understand that completely. There's nothing better than finding a hidden gem with amazing food and a laid-back vibe.     \n",
       "**Cornell:** Exactly! A cozy atmosphere and a friendly staff make the experience so much more enjoyable without emptying the wallet.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** For sure. There's this little diner on Elm Street that fits that description perfectly. Maybe we should go sometime!  \n",
       "**Mckenize:** I'm back! Sorry, took longer than I expected. What's this about a new diner?    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Hey, Mckenize! Arvilla was just telling me about a hidden gem on Elm Street. We were thinking of possibly checking it out.    \n",
       "**Mckenize:** That sounds interesting! I'll have to try and join next time. So, any plans for this weekend?    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Honestly, I'm still undecided. I might take a spontaneous road trip or just enjoy a relaxing weekend at home. How about you, Arvilla?    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** I'm planning a hiking trip. The leaves are starting to change, and it's the perfect weather for it. You're both welcome to join if you're interested!    \n",
       "**Mckenize:** That sounds wonderful! I'll think about it, but I just remembered I have to run some errands. I'll catch up with you all later.    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Alright, Mckenize! Take care. Let us know if you're joining any of the plans.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** Bye, Mckenize! Take care, and good luck with the errands.  \n",
       "**Isobella:** Hey everyone, I'm back! Thanks for waiting. So, speaking of fantastic meals, there's this new Italian place that just opened up in town. I was thinking it would be fun to try it out for dinner this weekend. Cornell, would you like to join me?    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Welcome back, Isobella! That sounds like a lovely idea, but unfortunately, I already have something to do this weekend. Maybe another time.    \n",
       "**Isobella:** Oh, no worries! I'll have to check it out and let you know how it is.    \n",
       "**Arvilla:** If it's as good as I hear, I'm sure it'll be amazing. Let us know if it lives up to the hype!    \n",
       "**Isobella:** Will do! And if it does, maybe we can all plan a visit sometime soon.    \n",
       "**Cornell:** Sounds great! I hope you have a wonderful time, Isobella. Enjoy that Italian cuisine!  "

       "**Darren:** So Crawford, I heard you have some exciting plans for the summer. What's this about learning piano?  \n",
       "**Crawford:** Yeah, I'm starting lessons next week. I’ve always wanted to learn how to play some of those cool songs I hear in movies.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** That sounds wonderful, Crawford! It's a great skill to have and so much fun. Have you decided on which songs you want to start with?  \n",
       "**Crawford:** I’m thinking of starting with something simple, maybe “Chopsticks,” and then I'll work my way up to some movie scores.  \n",
       "**Adrian:** Piano is such a fantastic instrument. You know, your mom was quite the pianist back in the day. She could play just about anything by ear!  \n",
       "**Darren:** Oh yes, Shiv was really impressive. You should see if she’d be willing to play a duet with you, Crawford!   \n",
       "**Shiv:** I'd love to. It would be great to play together. Maybe once you’re comfortable with the basics, we can try something fun as a duo.  \n",
       "**Crawford:** That sounds awesome! It’ll be fun to play with you, Mom. Uncle Adrian, have you ever played an instrument?  \n",
       "**Adrian:** I gave the guitar a go in college, but let's just say my talents lie elsewhere. I think I have more of a knack for listening than playing!  \n",
       "**Darren:** Well, you’ll have a front-row seat to Crawford's piano recitals. I'm sure you’ll be our biggest fan!  \n",
       "**Crawford:** Haha, thanks, Uncle Adrian! Speaking of music, I need to quickly troubleshoot my internet connection. I'll be right back!  \n",
       "**Adrian:** And I need to pop out too. I'm having a moment wondering if I turned off the coffee maker. I'll catch you all later!  \n",
       "[Crawford and Adrian leave the conversation.]  \n",
       "**Darren:** Alright, it's just us now. You know, Shiv, I think Crawford could really excel with some encouragement, especially when it comes to sticking with music.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** I agree. It can be disheartening to any budding musician when they're just beginning. Music theory is tough, but it’s not the only way to love music.  \n",
       "**Darren:** You're right. Maybe we can focus on boosting his confidence by emphasizing the joy of making music rather than worrying too much about the technical details just yet.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** Exactly. Plus, it could be a good idea to integrate some fun activities that relate to music theory, like composing his own simple tunes or experimenting with improvisation.   \n",
       "**Darren:** I think a mix of guidance and letting him explore on his own might be the perfect balance. We can highlight his progress and remind him that it's okay to have challenges along the way.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** Yes, and perhaps involving him in activities, like watching live performances or joining a local music club, can keep his interest alive and thriving.  \n",
       "**Adrian:** Hey, I'm back! Coffee maker was safely off, false alarm. What did I miss?  \n",
       "**Shiv:** Oh, welcome back, Adrian! We were just talking about how to keep Crawford motivated with his music lessons.  \n",
       "**Adrian:** Ah, speaking of Crawford and music, wasn’t he trying out the violin before? I remember him mentioning something like that.  \n",
       "**Darren:** Yes, he was taking some lessons. It’s a bit tricky for him, though. I think he finds the theory part overwhelming sometimes.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** Right, and he mentioned that he sometimes struggles to discern notes accurately, which doesn't make it any easier. But there are plenty of ways to improve with practice.  \n",
       "**Adrian:** Definitely. You know, I've read that sometimes just immersing oneself in the music can help naturally improve those skills over time. Anyway, I have to leave again. My phone's almost dead, and I need to charge it.  \n",
       "**Darren:** Alright, Adrian! Thanks for popping back in. We'll catch up later.  \n",
       "**Adrian:** Definitely. Good luck with the piano lessons, Crawford! Talk to you all soon.  \n",
       "**Crawford:** Hey everyone, I'm back!  \n",
       "**Darren:** Welcome back, Crawford! So, we were just chatting about your music lessons. Are you excited about them?  \n",
       "**Crawford:** Definitely! I've been dreaming about being a musician, and I love the idea of creating my own music one day.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** That's wonderful to hear! You’re really talented at music, and we truly believe you should keep that passion alive.  \n",
       "**Darren:** Absolutely! Keep up that motivation, Crawford. Your love for music is inspiring.  \n",
       "**Crawford:** Thanks, that means a lot to me. I can't wait to start learning and seeing where it takes me.  \n",
       "**Shiv:** We’re always here cheering you on, Crawford. Make sure to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.  "
