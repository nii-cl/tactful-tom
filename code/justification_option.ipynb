       " 'full_context': \"**Pearl**: So, I was thinking about food and I'm curious, what's everyone's favorite cuisine? I absolutely love Italian, especially a good risotto. It just feels like a warm hug in a bowl!\\n\\n**Jamey**: Oh, Italian is great! But for me, it's definitely Thai food. I love the bold flavors and the perfect balance of sweet, sour, and spicy. Pad Thai is my absolute favorite.\\n\\n**Marithza**: Thai is amazing, Jamey! For me, it's all about Japanese cuisine. I can't get enough of sushi and sashimi. It's so fresh and delicate, plus there's something exciting about eating with chopsticks.\\n\\n**Donyae**: Oh, all great choices! I'm all in for Mexican food. Tacos, enchiladas, and don't even get me started on the guacamole. It's just so satisfying.\\n\\n**Pearl**: Yum, I could eat some good guac every day. Has anyone tried making it from scratch? It's surprisingly easy and so much better than store-bought.\\n\\n**Jamey**: I have! I actually make a mean guacamole—and you're right, Pearl, fresh ingredients make all the difference. It's a hit whenever I have friends over.\\n\\n**Marithza**: I bet! Guacamole's a crowd pleaser for sure. On another note, I tried making homemade sushi once. Let’s say, rolling those little vinegared rice gems isn’t as easy as it looks!\\n\\n**Donyae**: I can imagine! But doing it yourself must be fun. Maybe we should have a cooking night sometime, where everyone brings a dish from their favorite cuisine.\\n\\n**Pearl**: That's a fantastic idea, Donyae! We could even make it like a friendly mini competition. Each dish gets a few points for taste and presentation. What do you guys think?\\n\\n**Jamey**: I'm totally in! It'll be a fun way to try different cuisines and maybe even learn a few new recipes from each other.**Donyae**: Awesome! I just remembered, I need to submit some papers before the end of the day. I'll catch you guys later, though. This cooking night sounds like such a blast—keep me posted!\\n\\n**Pearl**: Oh, I need to make a quick phone call. Let's definitely plan this out soon! Bye for now, everyone.\\n\\n**Marithza**: Bye, Donyae and Pearl! We’ll keep you in the loop. So, Jamey, what kind of place were you thinking about for our cooking night? We could do it at someone's house or rent out a small venue.\\n\\n**Jamey**: Honestly, I love the idea of just doing it at someone's house. It keeps things cozy and informal. Kind of like why I prefer casual dining places over the upscale spots. There's something special about a laid-back atmosphere.\\n\\n**Marithza**: I know what you mean. Sometimes those upscale places can feel a bit too… stiff, maybe? I guess it’s nice to just unwind and not worry about which fork to use—chat over some good food without all the fancy stuff.\\n\\n**Jamey**: Exactly! Plus, it can be pretty expensive going out to those places too often. I’d much rather hit up a cozy little diner or a local joint where you can really taste the love put into the cooking.\\n\\n**Marithza**: For sure! And there's something so genuine about finding that hole-in-the-wall spot with the best food. It kind of feels like discovering a secret everyone should know about.**Donyae**: Hey everyone, I'm back! I finally submitted all the papers. What did I miss?\\n\\n**Marithza**: Welcome back, Donyae! We were just talking about where to hold our cooking night. Jamey and I thought doing it at someone's house might be fun and cozy.\\n\\n**Donyae**: That sounds perfect! I think the home setting adds a nice personal touch. Plus, it's easier to relax and enjoy each other's company.\\n\\n**Jamey**: Absolutely, home-cooked vibes really can't be beat. Do you have a dish in mind for when we do this?\\n\\n**Donyae**: I'm thinking something classic like enchiladas. They are always a hit and not too complicated. By the way, I have to leave again now—I have a meeting starting soon that I need to prepare for.\\n\\n**Marithza**: No worries, Donyae. Thanks for popping back in! Let us know how the meeting goes.\\n\\n**Jamey**: Yeah, hope all goes well, Donyae! We'll continue planning and keep you updated.**Pearl**: Hey everyone, I'm back from my call! What did I miss in the world of culinary planning?\\n\\n**Jamey**: Welcome back, Pearl! We were chatting about turning our houses into five-star restaurants for our cooking night.\\n\\n**Pearl**: Sounds exciting! But speaking of five-star, there's this new Italian restaurant that just opened downtown. Would you all be interested in checking it out this weekend?\\n\\n**Jamey**: That sounds amazing, Pearl, but unfortunately, I have to work this weekend, so I can’t make it. Maybe next time?\\n\\n**Pearl**: Oh no, that’s a bummer! We'll definitely catch up soon then. Maybe for that cooking night we talked about—we can even bring some Italian-inspired dishes to you instead.\\n\\n**Marithza**: I’m up for the restaurant visit if it’s still on. I’ve been dying to try their truffle pasta from what I've heard.\\n\\n**Pearl**: Awesome, Marithza! Let's make it a date then. We'll let Donyae know and hopefully, she can join us too.\\n\\n**Jamey**: You guys enjoy it! Be sure to save me a slice of that truffle pasta, at least in spirit.\\n\\n**Marithza**: We will! And we’ll definitely share all the delicious details with you. Catch up soon, Jamey!\\n\\n**Pearl**: For sure, Jamey. Good luck with work, hope the weekend goes smoothly!\",\n",
